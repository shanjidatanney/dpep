                <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
                    My name is <span class="highlight-text">Shanjida Shahin Tanney</span>, and I am currently studying a Bachelor of Early Childhood Education at the IKON Institute of Australia. Alongside my studies, I am working as a Diploma-qualified educator at Jenny's ELC, The Arch, where I also had the valuable opportunity to complete my professional placement.

                    <h3>My Passion & Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>I am deeply passionate about creating inclusive, nurturing, and engaging learning environments where all children feel respected, supported, and valued. I believe that every child is unique, with their own strengths, abilities, and ways of learning, and I strive to foster an environment that celebrates diversity and encourages children to explore their world with curiosity and confidence.</p>

                    <h3>Current Role & Experience</h3>
                    <p>In my current role, I focus on building strong, respectful relationships with children and families while supporting each child's holistic development. I enjoy designing creative, play-based experiences that encourage problem-solving, self-expression, and social interaction, while also promoting a sense of belonging in the classroom.</p>

                    <h3>What Drives Me</h3>
                    <p>For me, the most rewarding part of being an educator is witnessing children grow in confidence, develop new skills, and feel proud of their achievements. I value collaboration with colleagues and actively reflect on my practice to ensure I am continuously improving and providing the best learning opportunities for children.</p>

                    <h3>Future Aspirations</h3>
                    <p>As I continue my Bachelor studies, I am eager to expand my knowledge of pedagogy, strengthen my practical teaching skills, and gain more experience across diverse educational settings. My long-term aspiration is to become a professional and reflective early childhood teacher who empowers children to reach their full potential and fosters a lifelong love of learning.</p>

            <h2>Reggio Emilia Philosophy</h2>
            <div style="background: white; padding: 2rem; border-radius: 15px; margin: 2rem 0;">
                <p>The centre follows the <span class="highlight-text">Reggio Emilia philosophy</span>, which views children as active participants in their own learning journey. In this approach, the environment is considered a <strong>"third teacher,"</strong> thoughtfully designed to stimulate exploration, imagination, and inquiry (Rinaldi, 2006).</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Core Values & Practices</h2>
            
            <div class="practice-element">
                <h4>Relationship Building</h4>
                <p>Educators at the centre prioritise building strong, respectful, and meaningful relationships with children and their families, fostering a sense of belonging, emotional safety, and trust (Dahlberg, Moss, & Pence, 2013).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="practice-element">
                <h4>Celebrating Diversity</h4>
                <p>The centre actively celebrates diversity and is committed to implementing inclusive practices that reflect and respect each child's unique identity, culture, and background (Australian Children's Education & Care Quality Authority [ACECQA], 2020).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="practice-element">
                <h4>Holistic Development</h4>
                <p>Children are encouraged to explore, express themselves, and engage with their surroundings in ways that support their holistic development. Through play, creativity, and guided experiences, children develop essential cognitive, emotional, social, and physical skills, laying a strong foundation for lifelong learning (Siraj-Blatchford et al., 2002).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="practice-element">
                <h4>Individualized Learning</h4>
                <p>The approach ensures that learning is meaningful, engaging, and tailored to each child's individual needs, interests, and abilities, allowing them to grow with confidence and a strong sense of self (Department of Education, Skills and Employment [DESE], 2022).</p>

            <div style="background: white; padding: 2rem; border-radius: 15px; margin: 2rem 0;">
                <h3>Topic Focus</h3>
                <p>My placement emphasized the importance of professionalism, including maintaining ethical standards, effective communication, and a commitment to continuous improvement.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Practical Example</h2>
            <div style="background: white; padding: 2rem; border-radius: 15px; margin: 2rem 0;">
                <p>Throughout my placement, I made sure to arrive on time, prepared for each activity, and communicate effectively with both colleagues and children. For instance, on Day 5, I led a group reading session with clarity and patience, ensuring that all children could follow along and participate. I also ensured children followed proper hygiene practices, such as washing their hands thoroughly after messy activities, including a snow sensory activity.</p>
                
                <p>The centre itself demonstrates professionalism through careful attention to staffing ratios, ensuring quality supervision and engagement. In the infant and toddler rooms, there is a ratio of four children per educator, while in the kindergarten rooms, there is one educator for every twelve children, supporting safe and individualized care.</p>
                
                <p>Professional reflection is also embedded into daily practice: each classroom has daily and weekly reflection books, where educators can document their observations, the children's engagement, and any notable outcomes from activities. Additionally, each educator is responsible for observing and documenting four children, completing jottings and observations to guide further planning. The centre also organizes monthly meetings for team reflection, discussion, and review of educational practices to ensure continuous improvement.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Theoretical Foundation</h2>
            <div class="practice-element">
                <p>The Australian Professional Standards for Teachers (APST) emphasize the importance of professionalism in all aspects of teaching, including communication, ethical behavior, and continuous reflection and improvement (AITSL, 2011). Similarly, NQS Standard 4 highlights the need for educators to maintain professionalism in all interactions and practices to support quality education and care. These practices, both personal and organizational, ensure that educators provide safe, reflective, and high-quality learning experiences for every child.</p>

            </div>

            <div style="background: white; padding: 2rem; border-radius: 15px; margin: 2rem 0;">
                <h3>Topic Focus</h3>
                <p>Play-based learning was a central aspect of my practice, offering children opportunities to explore, experiment, and develop a wide range of cognitive, social, emotional, and physical skills within a safe and stimulating environment.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Practical Example</h2>
			<div class="image-pair">
                <img src="images/pic3.jpg" alt="Play-based Learning Activity" class="portfolio-image">
                <img src="images/pic4.jpg" alt="Creative Learning Environment" class="portfolio-image">
            </div>
            <div style="background: white; padding: 2rem; border-radius: 15px; margin: 2rem 0;">
                <p>On Day 6, I led an outdoor science-inspired activity where children created "snow" using salt and vinegar. This sensory-rich experience supported their natural curiosity and introduced them to early scientific concepts such as cause-and-effect and chemical reactions (Edwards, 2017). It also engaged their fine motor skills as they poured, mixed, and observed changes.</p>
                
                <p>Indoors, I encouraged children to use playdough to make animals, which promoted creativity, symbolic representation, and problem-solving (Wood, 2014). The children compared their creations, exchanged ideas, and extended each other's play, which reflects the socially interactive nature of learning. I scaffolded their experiences by asking open-ended questions like, "What do you think will happen next?" or "How can you make your animal stand?" These prompts stimulated critical thinking, prediction-making, and extended language use (Fleer, 2010).</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Why it Matters</h2>
            <div style="background: white; padding: 2rem; border-radius: 15px; margin: 2rem 0;">
                <p>Play provided children with a safe, meaningful, and engaging avenue for exploration, where learning occurred naturally through discovery and social participation (Bodrova & Leong, 2015). Through play, children not only experimented with ideas but also built confidence and resilience when their strategies did not initially succeed. This aligns with the Early Years Learning Framework (EYLF), which identifies play as a foundation for fostering agency, problem-solving, and collaboration (Department of Education, 2018).</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Theoretical Foundation</h2>
            <div class="practice-element">
                <p>Vygotsky (1978) highlights that play is the "leading activity" in early childhood, allowing children to engage in higher-order thinking through social interaction and scaffolding within their Zone of Proximal Development. Piaget's (1962) theory also supports this practice, describing play as a way for children to construct knowledge and move through stages of cognitive development. The EYLF (Department of Education, 2018) further emphasizes that play-based pedagogies nurture holistic development, including identity, belonging, communication, and wellbeing.</p>

            <div style="background: white; padding: 2rem; border-radius: 15px; margin: 2rem 0;">
                <h3>Topic Focus</h3>
                <p>Respectful engagement and inclusivity were at the core of my interactions with children, forming the basis for positive learning experiences and social-emotional wellbeing.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Practical Example</h2>
            <div style="background: white; padding: 2rem; border-radius: 15px; margin: 2rem 0;">
                <p>During a reading session on Day 5, I encouraged a child named Raiden when he confidently identified objects in the story such as "apple" and "crab." By acknowledging his enthusiasm and providing specific positive feedback, I reinforced his confidence, made him feel included, and encouraged his peers to participate as well.</p>
                
                <p>I also adapted my communication strategies to meet children's different needs, using gestures, visual cues, and simplified language for younger children who were still developing verbal skills. For example, when engaging with a toddler who pointed at a picture, I modeled the word aloud and combined it with a gesture, ensuring inclusivity by making learning accessible for diverse learners.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Why it Matters</h2>
            <div style="background: white; padding: 2rem; border-radius: 15px; margin: 2rem 0;">
                <p>Inclusivity ensures that every child, regardless of their learning stage, cultural background, or developmental abilities, feels valued and respected. Research highlights that when children experience respect and recognition, their sense of identity and belonging is strengthened, which is essential for both confidence and engagement in learning (Arthur et al., 2018).</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Theoretical Foundation</h2>
            <div class="practice-element">
                <p>EYLF Outcome 1 emphasizes the importance of supporting children's identity and sense of belonging through respectful and culturally responsive interactions (Department of Education, 2018). Similarly, the National Quality Standard (NQS) Standard 5 highlights the value of responsive and respectful relationships as a foundation for children's social development and wellbeing (ACECQA, 2020).</p>

                <p>Respect for cultural diversity was a central focus of my teaching approach, ensuring that children developed an understanding and appreciation of different cultures, particularly during NAIDOC Week, which provided rich opportunities for learning about Australia's First Nations peoples.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Practical Example</h2>
            <div style="background: white; padding: 2rem; border-radius: 15px; margin: 2rem 0;">
                <p>On Day 2, I actively supported a smoking ceremony and facilitated a cultural music session with the children. They not only observed the rituals but also engaged by asking thoughtful questions and expressing curiosity about Indigenous practices.</p>
                
                <p>I extended this learning by linking cultural experiences with playful activities, such as dancing to traditional music, creating artworks inspired by Indigenous symbols, and storytelling sessions that explored cultural narratives. These experiences encouraged children to express themselves creatively while deepening their understanding of cultural traditions.</p>

                <p>Throughout my placement, I observed children experiencing a range of emotions, from frustration to sadness or excitement. On several occasions, when children became upset—such as during transitions between activities or after disagreements with peers—I comforted them by kneeling to their level, speaking gently, and validating their feelings. For example, when a child felt overwhelmed during a painting activity, I acknowledged their emotions and suggested a calming strategy, such as taking deep breaths before returning to their artwork.</p>
                
                <p>In addition to direct support, I recorded these observations in reflection books and shared them with colleagues to ensure ongoing and consistent care.

                <p>Gardner's (1983) Multiple Intelligences theory highlights that children learn in diverse ways, and creative expression supports multiple domains, including visual-spatial, linguistic, and interpersonal intelligences. The EYLF also values creative expression for identity formation, problem-solving, and exploration (Department of Education, 2018). By embedding sustainability into creative activities, the centre aligns play-based learning with real-world values, reinforcing curiosity, responsibility, and environmental awareness.</p>
